# SQL_DDL_Generator
Provides a complete SQL DDL statement for a Table/View. 

Created this SPROC after realizing that SQL Server does not  provide a way to programatically create 
DDL for tables / views. The only way that I am aware of to get this information in SQL Server is 
through the GUI, which is not always efficient.  For tables and views. this will provide a full DDL
"Create" statement programatically.
